## Lesson 1: The Visibility Gap
**Slides:** 01-04
**Images:** slide-01.png, slide-02.png, slide-03.png, slide-04.png

### Lesson Description:
You're working hard, delivering results, but somehow still invisible when opportunities arise. This isn't about your performance—it's about a visibility gap that affects high-achieving women of color at disproportionate rates. In this lesson, you'll understand why "head down, work hard" isn't enough and what's really driving your career plateau.

### Key Points:
- The data: Only 4% of C-suite executives are women of color (despite being 18% of the population)
- Your challenge isn't capability—it's visibility, positioning, and strategic sponsorship
- "You're Not Stuck. You're Ready to Elevate."

### Discussion Prompt:
Share a time when you felt your work was invisible despite delivering strong results. What did you do about it?

## Lesson 2: The Three Types of Plateaus
**Slides:** 05-08
**Images:** slide-05.png, slide-06.png, slide-07.png, slide-08.png

### Lesson Description:
Every career plateau falls into one of three categories. Understanding which type you're experiencing is the first step to breaking through. This lesson introduces the Skill Plateau, Role Plateau, and Identity Plateau frameworks.

### Key Points:
- **Skill Plateau:** You've maxed out current capabilities; need new skills or experiences
- **Role Plateau:** Your position has a ceiling; organizational constraints blocking advancement
- **Identity Plateau:** Internal barriers—imposter syndrome, perfectionism, playing small

### Discussion Prompt:
Which plateau type resonates most with where you are right now? Why?

## Lesson 3: Reflection - Breaking Through Stories
**Slides:** 09
**Images:** slide-09.png

### Lesson Description:
A moment for reflection. The barriers we face aren't always structural—sometimes they're the stories we've internalized.

### Quote:
> "The ceiling you're hitting isn't made of glass. It's made of stories you've been told—and stories you tell yourself."

### Reflection Prompt:
What story have you been telling yourself about why you can't advance? Write it down, then challenge it.

## Lesson 4: What's Driving Your Plateau
**Slides:** 10-11
**Images:** slide-10.png, slide-11.png

### Lesson Description:
Now that you understand the three plateau types, let's dig into the root causes. This lesson covers the six most common drivers keeping high-performers stuck.

### Key Points:
- Unclear Target: No defined "next best role"
- Unclear Value Proposition: Can't articulate your unique value
- Low Visibility: Decision-makers don't know your impact
- Weak Sponsorship: No one advocating for you in rooms you're not in
- Over-Functioning: Too busy doing everyone's work to focus on growth
- Fear and Avoidance: Avoiding visibility, conversations, or risks

## Lesson 5: The Stuck Loop
**Slides:** 12-13
**Images:** slide-12.png, slide-13.png

### Lesson Description:
Most career plateaus follow a predictable pattern—a "stuck loop" that repeats until you interrupt it with awareness and a new choice. This lesson helps you identify your personal stuck loop.

### The Loop:
Trigger → Thought → Emotion → Behavior → Outcome → (repeats)

### Example:
- **Trigger:** Asked to present to senior leadership
- **Thought:** "I'll mess this up. They'll see I don't belong."
- **Emotion:** Anxiety, dread
- **Behavior:** Over-prepare, speak too fast, minimize accomplishments
- **Outcome:** Presentation "fine" but exhausted and invisible

### Activity:

## Lesson 6: Building Your Career Growth Roadmap
**Slides:** 14-17
**Images:** slide-14.png, slide-15.png, slide-16.png, slide-17.png

### Lesson Description:
Time to build your action plan. This lesson guides you through creating a 12-month Career Growth Roadmap with clear goals, first moves, and success metrics.

### Roadmap Components:
1. **Your Next Best Role:** Where do you want to be in 12-18 months?
2. **Visibility Strategy:** How will decision-makers know your impact?
3. **Sponsorship Plan:** Who needs to advocate for you?
4. **Skill Development:** What capabilities do you need to build?
5. **First Moves:** What actions can you take in the next 14 days?

### Activities:
- Complete the **Career Growth Roadmap Worksheet**
- Complete the **Relationship Baseline Map**

## Lesson 7: Reflection - Start Before You're Ready
**Slides:** 18
**Images:** slide-18.png

### Lesson Description:
Another moment for reflection as you prepare to take action.

### Quote:
> "You don't have to be ready. You have to be willing to start before you feel prepared."

### Reflection Prompt:
What's one action you've been putting off because you don't feel "ready"? What would it take to do it anyway?

## Lesson 8: Key Takeaways & First Moves
**Slides:** 19-21
**Images:** slide-19.png, slide-20.png, slide-21.png

### Lesson Description:
Let's consolidate what you've learned and commit to your first moves.

### Key Takeaways:
1. **Plateaus Are Diagnosable:** Skill, Role, or Identity—knowing your type unlocks the right strategy
2. **Hard Work Alone Won't Get You There:** Strategic positioning, visibility, and sponsorship matter as much as performance
3. **Patterns Repeat Until Interrupted:** Your stuck loop will continue until you make a different choice
4. **Relationships Are Strategic Assets:** Who knows you matters as much as what you know
5. **Small Moves Create Momentum:** One visible action beats months of invisible perfection
